# Interrsect: Collaborative Note-Taking with ML


Notes are used by over 90% of students as a study tool and yet are only beneficial if written well. In order to do this, students must be proficient in understanding, memorizing, and writing content while keeping up with the lecture. This skill barrier prevents many from taking well-written notes; it is even more difficult for those with learning difficulties. Interrsect, a cost-free web application, was created with the aim of producing notes for study for those met with this skill barrier. It was powered by BARTxiv, a machine learning model based on Facebookâ€™s bart-large-cnn. This model was found to have the capability to crowdsource, summarize, and format lesson notes efficiently. BARTxiv expressed a ROUGE-1 score of 41.70, retaining over 40% of the original text in its summaries despite generating unique wording. This service underwent its first trial in a high school chemistry class and received positive feedback.
